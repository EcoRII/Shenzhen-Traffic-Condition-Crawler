# Shenzhen-Traffic-Crawler
Collect the data on the website of Shenzhen Transport Committee at fixed time and then create a .xls file.
Need python package xlwt.

Run Crawler.py for certain time and it will form a .txt file containing traffic condition posted on website of the Shenzhen Transport Committee.

Then after you think the program has collected enough data, kill it and run txt2excel.py. It will reformate the .txt file to a .xls file.
